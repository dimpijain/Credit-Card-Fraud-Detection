# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains anonymized transaction data with features that help in classifying whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.

## Features
-Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and balancing the dataset.
-Model training: Using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
-Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
-Visualization: Insights into fraudulent transaction patterns.

## Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset, which consists of anonymized transaction details. It can be downloaded from Kaggle: Credit Card Fraud Dataset.
